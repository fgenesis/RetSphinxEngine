- Scene editor / XML exporter
- Images should be able to save to file?
- Add ImGUI - super-simple GUI for editing
- Intelligently split things into subclasses, rather than having giant Engine and GameEngine classes that do everything
- Go through and find if globaldefs.h can be non-included in some header files

-GLM for math
	- mat4 for transformations
	v' = mat4 * (x,y,z,0) --> transform vector
	v' = mat4 * (x,y,z,1) --> transforms point (translate)
	m = scale * translate * rot --> rotate first, then translate, then scale
	projmat = cameramat * objmat (can be recursive by passing proj to child objects)
